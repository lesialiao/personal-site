This summer, I hope to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript while hard coding my own personal webpage. I'm using GitHub to document my work as well as share my progress with others interested. Through Swarthmore College's Computer Science department, I am thankful and able to host this site. To see my work in progress, check out cs.swarthmore.edu/~lliao1

Enjoy and wish me luck!
